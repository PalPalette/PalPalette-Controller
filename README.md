## Architecture Details

### State Machine

The firmware uses a state machine for robust operation:

1. **INIT** - System initialization
2. **WIFI_SETUP** - Captive portal or stored credentials
3. **WIFI_CONNECTING** - Attempting WiFi connection
4. **DEVICE_REGISTRATION** - Registering with backend
5. **WAITING_FOR_CLAIM** - Awaiting user claiming via app
6. **OPERATIONAL** - Normal operation, receiving color palettes
7. **ERROR** - Error state with recovery attempts

**Can't access setup portal**:

- Ensure device is in AP mode (check serial output)
- Connect to `PalPalette-Setup-XXXXXX` network
- Use password `setup123`
- Try accessing `192.168.4.1` directly

**Backend registration fails**:

- Verify server URL in setup
- Check server is running and accessible
- Ensure firewall allows connections on port 3000
- Check serial monitor for HTTP error codes

**Pairing code not working**:

- Ensure device is in WAITING_FOR_CLAIM state
- Check pairing code hasn't expired
- Verify mobile app is connected to same network/server
- Try resetting device and reclaiming

**Lighting system not connecting**:

- **For Nanoleaf**: Ensure panels are powered and on same network
- **For Nanoleaf**: Press and hold controller button during authentication
- Check lighting system IP address in setup portal
- Verify lighting hardware is supported and compatible
- Try mDNS discovery: Leave IP address empty for auto-discovery
- Monitor serial output for specific error messages

**System stability issues**:

- Check memory usage with `memory` serial command
- Monitor error logs with `errors` serial command
- Verify watchdog timer is functioning with `watchdog` command
- Check for repeated error/recovery cycles in serial output
