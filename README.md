## Architecture Details

### State Machine

The firmware uses a 7-state state machine for robust operation:

1. **STATE_INIT** - System initialization and hardware setup
2. **STATE_WIFI_SETUP** - Determine WiFi connection method (stored credentials or captive portal)
3. **STATE_WIFI_CONNECTING** - Attempting WiFi connection with retry logic
4. **STATE_DEVICE_REGISTRATION** - Registering device with backend server
5. **STATE_WAITING_FOR_CLAIM** - Awaiting user to claim device via mobile app
6. **STATE_OPERATIONAL** - Normal operation, receiving and displaying color palettes
7. **STATE_ERROR** - Error handling state with progressive recovery strategies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Device won't connect to WiFi**:

- Ensure 2.4GHz WiFi network
- Check password accuracy
- Verify signal strength
- Try factory reset: Send `reset` command via serial

**Can't access setup portal**:

- Ensure device is in AP mode (check serial output)
- Connect to `PalPalette-Setup-XXXXXX` network
- Use password `setup123`
- Try accessing `192.168.4.1` directly

**Backend registration fails**:

- Verify server URL in setup
- Check server is running and accessible
- Ensure firewall allows connections on port 3000
- Check serial monitor for HTTP error codes

**Pairing code not working**:

- Ensure device is in WAITING_FOR_CLAIM state
- Check pairing code hasn't expired
- Verify mobile app is connected to same network/server
- Try resetting device and reclaiming

**Nanoleaf panels not connecting**:

- Ensure Nanoleaf panels are powered on and connected to the same WiFi network
- Verify panels are discoverable (check Nanoleaf app connectivity)
- For auto-discovery: Leave IP address empty in setup portal
- For manual setup: Find Nanoleaf IP address in router or use Nanoleaf app
- **Authentication**: Press and hold the power button on Nanoleaf controller for 5-7 seconds when prompted by mobile app
- Check serial monitor for mDNS discovery messages and authentication status
- Try factory reset of Nanoleaf panels if authentication repeatedly fails

**System stability issues**:

- Check memory usage with `memory` serial command
- Monitor error logs with `errors` serial command
- Verify watchdog timer is functioning with `watchdog` command
- Check for repeated error/recovery cycles in serial output

### Factory Reset

To completely reset the device:

1. Connect via serial monitor
2. Send command: `reset`
3. Device will clear all settings and restart
4. Follow first-time setup process

## Development

### Building Custom Firmware

1. Modify configuration in `config.h`
2. Update version number in `config.h`
3. Build and test on device
4. Update this README with any changes

### Adding Features

The modular architecture makes adding features straightforward:

- **WiFi-related features**: Add to `WiFiManager` class
- **Device features**: Add to `DeviceManager` class
- **Communication features**: Add to `WSClient` class
- **New lighting hardware**: Implement `LightController` interface
- **Error handling**: Add error codes to `config.h` and recovery strategies
- **New functionality**: Create new modules following existing patterns

### Adding New Lighting Controllers

To add support for new lighting hardware:

1. **Create Controller Class**: Extend `LightController` base class in `src/lighting/controllers/`
2. **Implement Interface**: Provide all required methods (initialize, displayPalette, turnOff, etc.)
3. **Register with Factory**: Add to supported systems array and factory method in `LightController.cpp`
4. **Add to Validation**: Update `isSystemSupported` method in `LightController.cpp`
5. **Update Setup Portal**: Add new system option to captive portal HTML in `WiFiManager.cpp`
6. **Test Integration**: Verify with debug commands and WebSocket communication

**Example**: The current `NanoleafController` implementation provides a complete reference for adding new lighting systems.
